# Research Priority Hierarchy (MANDATORY)

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16

## 🔬 Research Stack (Use in This Order)

### 1. Deep Research (ChatGPT) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Use for:**
- Architecture decisions
- System design
- Best practices analysis
- Cost/performance tradeoffs
- Technology comparisons
- Strategic planning

**When to use:** ALWAYS for architectural decisions

### 2. Perplexity - REAL-TIME CONTEXT
**Use for:**
- Current events
- Latest news
- Real-time data
- Trending topics
- Recent changes

**When to use:** When you need up-to-the-minute information

### 3. Web Search (Brave) - GENERAL RESEARCH
**Use for:**
- Finding resources
- Quick facts
- Documentation lookup
- General queries

**When to use:** For broad research before Deep Research

### 4. Web Fetch - SPECIFIC SOURCES
**Use for:**
- Reading specific URLs
- Documentation pages
- Blog posts
- Known sources

**When to use:** When you have a specific source to check

### 5. Skills - TOOL KNOWLEDGE
**Use for:**
- Tool-specific operations
- Command references
- Integration details

**When to use:** When using specific tools (GitHub, n8n, etc.)

## 📋 Research Process

1. **Add topics** to queue as they come up
2. **Every 2-3 hours:** Run Deep Research on 10 topics from queue
3. **Document findings** in `memory/research/YYYY-MM-DD-{topic}.md`
4. **Update this file** with completed topics
5. **Use findings** for architectural decisions
